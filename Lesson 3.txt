When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    If it was only local, you would not have the ability to be mobile or to use
    other machines while travelling. Others would not be able to contribute
    unless they were on the same machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone might be working on the same piece of code, and automatic updates
    could really screw up both of your code. Plus, how would it determine 
    anything amiss?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone puts a copy from one place to somewhere on your local machine
    (either fron github or somewhere else on your machine). A fork is the same,
    except the copy is stored in your section of github.

    Use fork when you are using someone else's base code and will
    give credit to the owner like an ethical coder would.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
